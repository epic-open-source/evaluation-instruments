# Complete note definition:

A note is deemed to be complete if the note possesses all three elements as described by elements 1, 2, 3 below:

Element 1) Appropriate history
This can be achieved by including EITHER of these two information (sub-element 1a OR 1b below) in the clinical note:
1a) Comment from the patient like "patient's cough is improving" or a note that patient is not able to comment on his/her well-being
1b) An interval update on what happened in the hospital course

Element 2) Appropriate exam
This can be achieved by including BOTH of these two information (sub-element 2c AND 2d below) in the clinical note:
2c) An all-encompassing description of the patient. Examples of an all-encompassing description of the patient are phrases like `awake and alert`, `chronically ill-appearing`, `toxic-appearing`, `resting comfortably`. 
2d) All systems that are pertinent to the complaint or history. For example, a complaint of a dog bite must be accompanied with a notation of a bite on the physical exam.

Element 3) Appropriate Plan
This can be achieved by including any information regarding clinical management of the primary reason the patient has been hospitalized.

Does this note have all three elements of a complete note?


A1:
1) Appropriate history:
The note includes a comment from the patient, specifically "Patient's cough is improving." This indicates the patient's subjective experience of their symptoms and their progress. The note provides an interval update on the hospital course, detailing the patient's responsiveness, interaction, swallowing evaluation, and oxygen levels. It also mentions the patient's history of COVID Pneumonia, Afib, hypertension, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, and failure to thrive over the last 2 months.

2) Appropriate exam:
The note provides an all-encompassing description of the patient, describing them as "Chronically ill appearing, alert, interactive, follows simple commands." This gives a comprehensive overview of the patient's current state. The note includes all systems pertinent to the complaint or history. The patient's vitals are listed, and the physical exam includes a note about the bite mark on the right arm, which is relevant to the patient's history.

3) Appropriate Plan:
The note outlines a detailed plan for the clinical management of the primary reason the patient has been hospitalized. This includes the treatment of HCAP with Zosyn, monitoring and treatment of the dog bite, management of volume overload with Lasix, continuation of Afib treatment with diltiazem and apixaban, re-checking of creatinine levels for CKD, pain control with Dilaudid, and continuation of home medications. The plan also includes a diet plan, DVT prophylaxis with apixaban, and communication with the patient's daughter. The note also mentions the goal of home hospice and an expected discharge date.

Given that this note has all three elements of a complete note, this note is a complete note.

Does this note have all three elements of a complete note?

A2:
1) Appropriate history:
The note includes: "Patient had clear liquids with out complication. Advancing to full liquids. Patient denies chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain or dizziness." This satisfies sub-element 1a (patient comment). Therefore, Element 1 is satisfied.

2) Appropriate Exam:
The note includes vital signs and descriptions like "Normocephalic and atraumatic," "Normal heart sounds," "Pulmonary effort is normal," "Normal breath sounds," "There is no distension," "Abdomen is soft," "There is no abdominal tenderness," "No tenderness," "Neck supple." However, the note does not contain an all-encompassing description of the patient such as "awake and alert", "chronically ill-appearing", "toxic-appearing", or "resting comfortably". Therefore, Element 2 is NOT satisfied.

3) Appropriate Plan
The note includes detailed plans for diet advancement, medication (Protonix, metoprolol, aspirin), lab monitoring, antibiotic management, pain management, and discharge planning. It also mentions specific GI recommendations and cardiology follow-up.
Therefore, Element 3 is satisfied.

Given that this note does not have all three elements of a complete note, this note is not a complete note.

CURRENT TASK
---------

Given the following note, does the note contain all three elements of a complete note?
Let's think step by step. Take a deep breath. If the note has all three elements (Appropriate history [satisfies *EITHER* sub-element 1a or sub-element 1b above], Appropriate exam [satisfies *BOTH* sub-element 2c and 2d above], and Appropriate Plan [including any information regarding clinical management of the primary reason the patient has been hospitalized]) of a complete note, return the final classification output of '1'. Else, return the final classification output of '0'. Use chain-of-thought to derive your final classification output. 

Return your final output as json with the following: use the word complete as the key and 1 or 0 as the value. Make sure you have gone through all of the steps and ensure you have followed the output format I have mentioned above. Your final classification is fed into a hospital safety-critical system so it must be as accurate as possible. Think carefully, and give merit to notes that are deserving of a final classification of 1.

# Clinical Reasoning and Assessment note definition:

A note is deemed to have clinical reasoning and assessment if the note possesses at least one of the two elements as described below:

1. Appropriate differential diagnosis
This can be achieved by including at least 2 competing illnesses. For example, 'HFrEF exacerbation vs. PNA vs. PE.'

2. Well-articulated medical decision-making
This can be achieved by committing to a clear diagnosis with a trajectory on how the patient is doing. For example, 'patient has acute exacerbation of HFrEF – improving.'

###

Based on this definition of a note with clinical reasoning and assessment, here are two examples for you to learn from:

EXAMPLE 1
---------

Q1: Using this note: Progress Note Subjective & Notable Events Hospital Day: 4: Patient appears more comfortable today. More responsive and less dyspneic. Maintaining well on 2L O2, which is her home level. Physical Exam Last Vitals: | BP: 135/80 | Heart Rate: 88 | Temp: 36.6 ?C (97.9 ?F) | Resp: 18 | SpO2: 97 %, O2 Device: Nasal cannula | Lines and Drains: Physical Exam Chronically ill appearing Alert, responsive, follows simple commands Regular rhythm, no murmurs Clear to auscultation bilaterally Soft, non-tender, non-distended No peripheral edema Laboratory Test & Imaging Review Notable findings: No new labs today Assessment & Plan Assessment: 88F with history of COVID PNA 3 months ago now on home o2 (2L), Afib on apixaban, hypertension, T2DM and failure to thrive over the last 3 months presents with tachypnea/hypoxia admitted for HCAP which was present on admission. Differential diagnosis includes HFrEF exacerbation vs. PNA vs. PE. However, patient's clinical picture is more consistent with acute exacerbation of HFrEF – improving. Patient has been in inpatient/subacute rehab setting for past 3 months consecutively and is now chronically bedbound. Long conversation with family member and goals are for home hospice. Plan: #HFrEF exacerbation - improving with diuretics. Continue lasix. Monitor for fluid overload. TTE pending. #HCAP present on admission - improving with zosyn. Discontinue vancomycin. Treat for 5-7 day course. #Afib - continue diltiazem and apixaban #CKD - Unclear baseline creatinine but as discussed with family member, focused more on treating the patient clinically as compared to aiming for specific numbers. Re-check creatinine tomorrow. #pain control - dilaudid prn for comfort #home meds - statin, singulair, melatonin, folate, thiamine Diet: pureed / thin liquids DVT: apixaban Communicated with: family member Discharge Milestones & Contingency Planning Likely 5/22 with home hospice Expected Date of Discharge:

Does this note have at least one of the two elements of clinical reasoning and assessment?

A1: 
1. Appropriate Differential Diagnosis: Yes, this note does include an appropriate differential diagnosis. The note mentions three potential competing illnesses: 'HFrEF exacerbation vs. PNA vs. PE.' These are all reasonable diagnoses to consider given the patient's presentation of tachypnea and hypoxia.

2. Well-articulated Medical Decision-making: Yes, the note also includes well-articulated medical decision-making. The note commits to a clear diagnosis: 'patient's clinical picture is more consistent with acute exacerbation of HFrEF – improving.' This statement not only identifies the most likely diagnosis but also provides a trajectory on how the patient is doing, which is that the patient is improving.

Given that this note has at least one of the two elements of clinical reasoning and assessment, this note has clinical reasoning and assessment.

Q2:Using this note: Progress Note Subjective & Notable Events Hospital Day: 11: Seen and examined. Abdominal pain. Vomiting. Tachycardia. Physical Exam Last Vitals: | BP: 154/97 (07/14/24 0756) | Heart Rate: (!) 113 (07/14/24 0756) | Temp: 36.5 ?C (97.7 ?F) (07/14/24 0756) | Resp: 17 (07/14/24 0756) | SpO2: 93 % (07/14/24 0756), O2 Device: None (Room air) (07/13/24 1705) | Lines and Drains: IV access.

N.p.o. except meds. IV fluids. Lab workup. X-ray of the abdomen. Plan accordingly. Diet: N.p.o. DVT: Anticoagulation anticoagulation Communicated with: Consultant Discharge Milestones & Contingency Planning Expected Date of Discharge: 7/14/2024 12:00 PM

Does this note have at least one of the two elements of clinical reasoning and assessment?

A2: 
1. Appropriate differential diagnosis: The note lists "atrial fibrillation with rapid regular response, abdominal pain, on nausea vomiting, acute proctitis dissolving". While it identifies these problems, it doesn't offer a differential diagnosis for the abdominal pain and vomiting. It doesn't consider potential causes like bowel obstruction, ileus, gastritis, or other intra-abdominal pathology.

2. Well-articulated medical decision-making: The note's plan is vague and lacks specific details. It states "Plan to discharge," but the patient is experiencing abdominal pain, vomiting, and tachycardia. The plan includes "N.p.o. except meds," "IV fluids," "Lab workup," and "X-ray of the abdomen," but it doesn't specify which labs are being ordered or what the clinical suspicion is. The phrase "Plan accordingly" is too general and doesn't demonstrate a clear decision-making process. Given the patient's symptoms, discharging the patient without a clear diagnosis or treatment plan for the abdominal pain and vomiting is questionable.

Given that this note lacks both elements of clinical reasoning and assessment, it has no clinical reasoning and assessment.

# Contingency planning note definition:

A note is deemed to have contingency planning if the note has at least one of the two elements as described below:

1. Appropriate articulation of an “if/ then” analysis
For example, "if afebrile overnight, we will switch IV ceftriaxone to po vantin”, “if
patient tolerates 6L O2 or less, may be transferred out of ICU to floor."

2. Appropriate articulation of the medical milestone(s) that needs to happen prior to discharge 
For example, “If patient is afebrile overnight AND if WBC count is <12K, patient may
be discharged home tomorrow DBN”

###

Based on this definition of a note with contingency planning, here are two examples for you to learn from:

EXAMPLE 1
---------

Q1: Using this note: Progress Note Subjective & Notable Events Hospital Day: 4: Patient appears more comfortable today. More responsive and less dyspneic.

Likely 5/20 with home hospice Expected Date of Discharge:

Does this note have any of the two elements of contingency planning?

A1: 
1. Appropriate articulation of an “if/ then” analysis: This is seen in two instances in the note. The first instance is, "If patient remains afebrile overnight, we will switch IV zosyn to po vantin." This means that if the patient does not have a fever overnight, the medical team will change the patient's medication from intravenous zosyn to oral vantin. The second instance is, "If patient tolerates 6L O2 or less, may be transferred out of ICU to floor." This means that if the patient can tolerate a lower level of oxygen (6 liters or less), they may be moved from the Intensive Care Unit to a regular hospital floor.

2. Appropriate articulation of the medical milestone(s) that needs to happen prior to discharge: This is seen in the note where it says, "If patient is afebrile overnight AND if WBC count is <12K, patient may be discharged home tomorrow DBN." This means that if the patient does not have a fever overnight and if their white blood cell count is less than 12,000, they may be discharged to go home the next day. This is a clear articulation of the medical milestones that need to be achieved before the patient can be discharged.

A2:
1. Appropriate articulation of an “if/ then” analysis:
There is no explicit "if/ then" statement in the note. The plan mentions follow-up repeat blood cultures and further recommendations after the results, but it does not use the "if/ then" structure. For example, a statement like "if blood cultures are negative, then we will discontinue IV vancomycin" would be an appropriate "if/ then" analysis, but such a statement is not present in the note.

2. Appropriate articulation of the medical milestone(s) that needs to happen prior to discharge:
The note does not specify any medical milestones or conditions that need to be met before the patient can be discharged. It focuses on the current treatment plan and follow-up actions but does not mention discharge criteria. For example, a statement like "if the patient's WBC count returns to normal and they remain afebrile for 24 hours, they may be discharged" would be an appropriate articulation of medical milestones prior to discharge, but such a statement is not present in the note.

Given that this note has at least one of the two elements of contingency planning, this note has contingency planning.

Does this note cotain minimal to no imported lists of labs, studies, medications, vital signs?

A1:
The note provides a brief summary of the patient's current condition, physical exam, and notable lab findings. The assessment and plan section is detailed but focused, outlining the patient's main issues and the corresponding plans of action. The imported lists of labs, studies, medications, or vital signs, even if present, is still just minimal and brief. The note sticks to the essential information needed for understanding the patient's current status and plan of care. Therefore, since the note does not contain excessive copy-forwarded information and imported lists of labs, studies, medications, and vital signs, this note is concise.

Does this note contain minimal to no imported lists of labs, studies, medications, vital signs?

A2: 
This note contains a lot of detailed information. It includes extensive and excessive lists of lab results. The assessment and plan section is also quite lengthy, with a lot of detail about the patient's various conditions and the corresponding plans of action. This note does not adhere to the definition of a concise note as it contains excessive copy-forwarded information and imported lists of labs, studies, medications, and vital signs. Therefore, this note is not concise.

###


CURRENT TASK
---------
Given the following note, does this note contain minimal and brief to no imported lists of labs, studies, medications, vital signs? Let's think step by step and pay close attention to the two examples above. Take note of the strucutre of the notes and explanations to the answers in the two examples above. Take a deep breath. If the note has minimal and brief to no imported lists of labs, studies, medications, vital signs, return the final classification output of '1'. If there is an imported list of labs, studies, medications, vital signs, but it is not excessive and it is brief as in example 1 above, return the final classification output of '1'. Else, return the final classification output of '0'.  

Return your final output as json with the following: use the word concise as the key and 1 or 0 as the value. Make sure you have gone through all of the steps and ensure you have followed the output format I have mentioned above. Your final classification is fed into a hospital safety-critical system so it must be as accurate as possible. Think carefully, and give merit to notes that are deserving of a final classification of 1.

CORRECT_PROMPT = """
# Correct note definition:

A note is deemed to be correct if the note possesses both elements as described below:

1. Internal Consistency: The information within the note should not contradict itself. For instance, if the interval history indicates that the Endotracheal Tube (ETT) has been removed, the Physical Examination (PE) section should not mention the presence of an ETT.

2. Absence of Critical Deficiencies: The note should contain all vital information relevant to the patient's condition. For instance, in a patient diagnosed with Pneumonia (PNA), the note must include the Oxygen (O2) level.

###

Based on this definition of a correct note, here are two examples for you to learn from:

EXAMPLE 1:
----

Q1: Using this note: Progress Note Subjective & Notable Events Hospital Day: 4: Continues to show improvement. More alert and interactive. Passed another swallow eval. Maintaining at 2L O2, her home level. Physical Exam Last Vitals: | BP: 138/78 | Heart Rate: 88 | Temp: 36.5 ?C (97.7 ?F) | Resp: 16 | SpO2: 97 %, O2 Device: Nasal cannula | Lines and Drains: Physical Exam Chronically ill appearing Alert, interactive, follows simple commands rrr ctab Soft, nt/nd B/l swollen hands, no LE edema Laboratory Test & Imaging Review Notable findings: No new labs today Assessment & Plan Assessment: 88F h/o COVID PNA 3 months ago now on home o2 (2L) Afib on apixaban, htn, T2DM and FTT over the last 3 months presents after recent dc from *** with tachypnea/hypoxia admitted for HCAP which was present on admission improving with abx. Pt has been in IP/SAR setting for past 3 months consecutively and is now chronically bedbound. Long conversation with *** and goals are for home hospice.

Given overarching GOC would not favor invasive w/u / thora at this time. #Vol overload - improved with lasix. Now close to euvolemic though b/l hands edematous. Check duplex UE. Monitor off lasix.

TTE pending. #Afib - cont dilt and apixaban #CKD - Unclear baseline Cr but as discussed with ***, focused more on treating the patient clinically as compared to aiming for specific numbers. Re-check Cr tomm. #pain control - dilaudid prn for comfort #home meds - statin, singulair, melatonin, folate, thiamine Diet: pureed / thin liquids DVT: apixaban Communicated with: *** Discharge Milestones & Contingency Planning Likely *** with home hospice Expected Date of Discharge:

Does this note have both elements of a correct note?

A1: 
1. Internal Consistency: The note appears to be internally consistent. The subjective and notable events section aligns with the physical exam and assessment & plan sections. For example, the patient's improved alertness and interactivity noted in the subjective section are consistent with the physical exam findings. The patient's history of COVID PNA, Afib, htn, T2DM, and FTT are also consistently addressed in the assessment and plan. There are no contradictions such as the removal of an ETT but still mentioning it in the physical exam.

2. Absence of Critical Deficiencies: The note appears to be free of critical deficiencies. The patient has a history of pneumonia (PNA), and the note indicates that the patient's O2 levels were monitored, with a SpO2 level of 97% on a nasal cannula at 2L, which is the patient's home level. This is crucial information for a patient with a history of PNA, as it helps to assess the patient's respiratory status and guide treatment decisions. All other necessary information, such as vitals and assessment & plan, are also included in the note.

Given that this note has both elements of a correct note, this note is a correct note.

Hepatology consulted for elevated liver enzymes. Differential diagnosis includes autoimmune, DILI versus COVID-19 versus recurrent choledocholithiasis. MRCP without biliary dilation. New septic process (hypoxia/hypotension) is 2/2 to PNA versus biliary source given recent history of recurrent cholangitis. Significant uptrend in leukocytosis. Culture data remains negative.

We discussed the limited utility of liver biopsy in this setting. - Maximum 2 g of tylenol a day - Ursodiol 300 mg twice daily - We will continue to follow *** MD, MPH PGY5 GI Fellow

A2:

1. Internal Consistency: The note appears internally consistent. The interval events, physical exam, lab results, and assessment/plan do not contradict each other. For example, the improving leukocytosis mentioned in the interval events is supported by the lab results showing a decreasing WBC count. The patient's subjective experience of "eating well no pain" aligns with the physical exam findings of a soft, non-tender abdomen.

2. Absence of Critical Deficiences: The note contains a good amount of detail, including interval events, subjective information, physical exam findings, lab results, and an assessment and plan. However, for a patient with pneumonia (PNA) mentioned in the assessment, the O2 level is not explicitly stated in the physical exam or elsewhere in the note. While the note mentions "Breathing comfortably," a specific oxygen saturation or method of oxygen delivery is missing. This is a critical deficiency for a patient with pneumonia.

Given that this note does not have both elements of a correct note, this note is not a correct note.

###
