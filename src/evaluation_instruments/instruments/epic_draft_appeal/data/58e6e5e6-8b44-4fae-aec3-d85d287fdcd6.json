        "O1": "MRI BRAIN COMBO\n6/6/2024  2:04 PM\n\n EXAMINATION: MRI BRAIN WO/W CONTRAST CLINICAL INDICATION: f/u pituitary adenoma. 25 year old woman presenting in follow up after undergoing a combined endoscopic endonasal and bifrontal/ right temporal craniotomy for resection of a giant pituitary adenoma having undergone presumed apoplexy 5/30/2024. Now has worsening sinus pain and headache. TECHNIQUE: MRI Head without and with contrast: Pituitary- Macro adenoma (B 8) Non-contrast: DWI, Sagittal high resolution T1.  Coronal, high resolution T1, T2. Axial FLAIR post-contrast: Sagittal and coronal high resolution T1 with fat sat, COMPARISON: 06/06/2024 brain MRI FINDINGS: MASS EFFECT & VENTRICLES: No shift. The lateral ventricles are symmetric. The ventricles, sulci and cisterns are age appropriate in size. BRAIN: There is no acute infarct nor acute parenchymal hemorrhage. Mild FLAIR hyperintensity are seen in the right frontal lobe along with a previous ventriculostomy catheter tract. Additional mild FLAIR hyperintensity seen in the bifrontal lobes, likely secondary to traction from previous craniotomy. Additional non specific minimal FLAIR hyperintensities are see in the subcortical white matter. Furthermore there is mild FLAIR hyperintensity seen in the medial frontal loves bilaterally, possibly secondary from prior mass effect from giant macroadenoma. PITUITARY GLAND: There is redemonstration of a suprasellar enhancing, T1 isointense, T2 mildly hyperintense soft tissue which encases with proximal anterior cerebral arteries as well as extends laterally into the right cavernous sinus consistent with a Knosp grade 3/4, as well as abutting the left cavernous sinus consistent with a Knosp grade 2. Additionally post surgical changes are seen within the sella in this patient status post combined endoscopic and bifrontal craniotomy for giant macroadenoma resection with some internal areas of hemorrhage. The native posterior pituitary bright spot is possibly seen displaced anteriorly near the infundibulum on series 301 image 6. The native pituitary tissue enhances appropriately. There is residual hypoenhancing tissue seen within the sella as well as cavernous sinuses which may be postsurgical or residual. CHIASM: Optic chiasm is not compressed. There is however some T2 hyperintensity consistent with previous compression. VASCULAR: Cavernous carotid vascular flow voids are normal in size and position. EXTRA-CRANIAL: Postsurgical changes are seen in the sphenoid sinus. Redemonstration of clival invasion. The prechiasmatic optic nerves are again mildly splayed laterally.\n Residual tumor in the sellar and suprasellar region as described as well as involvement of the clivus and sphenoid sinus. Involvement of the right greater than left cavernous sinuses as well as encasement of the proximal anterior cerebral arteries. Appearance is similar to MRI on 12/12/2023. FINAL REPORT: Agree with above.  I have personally reviewed the images and agree with the report (or as edited)."

        "N1": "Patient with a history of giant pituitary macroadenoma presents symptoms of somnolence, disorientation, nausea, headaches, and fatigue and has been found to have residual tumor in the sellar and suprasellar region, with involvement of the clivus and sphenoid sinus, following an endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery.",
        "N2": "This is a 25 year old female with a history of giant pituitary macroadenoma, who underwent endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery with craniotomy. She presented with a 2-day history of headache, nausea, and vision problems in the right eye, and was found to have a 4.1 x 4.7 x 6.2 cm sellar mass with suprasellar extension and involvement of the cavernous sinuses and clivus. Postoperatively, she experienced somnolence and disorientation, and was started on stress dose steroids for presumed central adrenal insufficiency. Pathology reveled a corticotroph pituitary neuroendocrine tumor with bone and soft tissue invasion. She has since experienced symptoms such as nausea, headaches, and fatigue, and has been found to have residual tumor in the sellar and suprasellar region, with involvement of the clivus and sphenoid sinus. She has undergone a Cosyntropin stim test and will be monitored for thyroid function and adrenal axis recovery. She is also being evaluated for symptoms and discomfort at the suture line, and will continue to have long-term follow up for pituitary function and imaging surveillance."

    "basis": "The MRI of the brain with and without contrast is medically necessary for Madison May due to the following reasons:\n\n- Madison has a history of a giant pituitary macroadenoma, which has been partially resected but with residual tumor present in the sellar and suprasellar regions, as well as involvement of the clivus and sphenoid sinus. This necessitates ongoing imaging to monitor the extent of the residual tumor and any potential changes in its size or characteristics [N1, N2].\n- The MRI findings indicate that the residual tumor encases the proximal anterior cerebral arteries and extends into the right cavernous sinus, with potential implications for vascular and neurological function. Monitoring these areas is critical to prevent further complications [O1].\n- Madison is experiencing worsening symptoms, including sinus pain and headaches, which could be related to the residual tumor or post-surgical changes. The MRI helps in assessing these symptoms and guiding further management [O1].\n- The MRI is essential for evaluating the post-surgical changes and ensuring there is no new compression of the optic chiasm or other critical structures, which could affect vision and neurological function [O1].\n- Given the complexity of the case, including the involvement of multiple cranial structures and the potential for further surgical or medical intervention, regular imaging is crucial for comprehensive management and planning [N2]."
