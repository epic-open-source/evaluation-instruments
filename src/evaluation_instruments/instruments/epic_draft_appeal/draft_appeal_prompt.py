<TextFormat>
DESCRIPTION: The basis for appeal concisely and clearly lays out the supporting evidence for its argument.

GRADES:

This tone significantly detracts from the appeal's credibility and effectiveness.
2 = The tone is somewhat inconsistent and may occasionally veer into being informal or slightly unprofessional.

3 = The tone is generally neutral and informational, aiming for objectivity without significant engagement or persuasion.

    "MedicalNecessity": """
<MedicalNecessity>
DESCRIPTION: The basis for appeal adequately forms an argument that justifies the medical necessity of the denied procedures.

GRADES:
1 = The claim of medical necessity is not supported at all. The appeal includes information completely irrelevant to the claim or misunderstands the concept of medical necessity.

3 = The claim of medical necessity is partially supported with a basic argument. The appeal uses some references that are relevant to medical necessity, but the overall argument lacks depth or comprehensive substantiation. This level shows an attempt to support the claim but with limitations in the strength or clarity of the argument.
4 = The claim of medical necessity is well-supported through a coherent and persuasive argument. The appeal makes good use of appropriate references that directly support the claim of medical necessity. There may be minor areas for improvement in the depth or breadth of the argument, but overall, it demonstrates a solid understanding and substantiation of medical necessity.
5 = The claim of medical necessity is supported in an exceptionally coherent, detailed, and persuasive argument.
