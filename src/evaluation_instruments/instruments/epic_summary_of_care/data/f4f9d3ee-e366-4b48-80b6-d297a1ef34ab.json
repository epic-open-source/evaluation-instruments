A CXR shows bilateral interstitial markings with a developing pleural effusion on the left. ECG shows no signs of ischemia and his troponins are normal. Her BNP is elevated, consistent with an exacerbation of his CHF. \n \nShe was given IV furosemide with brisk UOP response, but her respiratory status remains unchanged with tachypnea and an oxygen requirement. \n \nGiven her ongoing signs of respiratory compromise, the patient will be admitted for further assessment and monitoring. \n \nMDM\n"

    "summary": "During Kim Pope's hospital stay on 8/7/2024, they were admitted due to worsening symptoms of chronic systolic congestive heart failure, including shortness of breath, fatigue, and ankle swelling, exacerbated by non-compliance with a low-sodium diet [N1, N2]. Diagnostic tests revealed elevated B-type natriuretic peptide levels, hypoxemia, and interstitial fluid on chest X-ray, indicating heart failure exacerbation [O2, O6, O7]. Despite treatment with IV furosemide for diuresis, their respiratory status did not return to baseline, necessitating continued monitoring and management [N2]. The care plan included electrolyte management, telemetry monitoring, oxygen support, and education on dietary compliance, alongside their regular medications [N1]."
