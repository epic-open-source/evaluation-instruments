<Tone>
DESCRIPTION: The summary of care is written with a formal and professional tone.

GRADES:
1 = The tone of the text is highly inconsistent, often confusing, and may include offensive or highly inappropriate language. It fails to maintain a professional demeanor, using slang, jargon, or a casual style that undermines the seriousness and professionalism expected in a medical summary. This tone significantly detracts from the summary's credibility and effectiveness.
2 = The tone is somewhat inconsistent and may occasionally veer into being informal or slightly unprofessional. There might be instances of slang, overly casual language, or a conversational style that is not suited for the context of a medical summary. While not overtly offensive, the tone does not fully convey the required professionalism and respectfulness.
3 = The tone is generally neutral and informational, aiming for objectivity without significant engagement or persuasion. Minor instances of slang or informal language may be present but do not dominate the text. The tone is acceptable but lacks the professionalism that might make the summary more compelling.
4 = The tone is professional and mostly engaging. Slang or informal language is minimal or expertly integrated in a way that does not detract from the professionalism. The tone is respectful and appropriate for the context, enhancing the summary's credibility.
5 = The tone is consistently professional, engaging, and perfectly suited to the context of a medical summary. It maintains a formal yet accessible style, with no slang or informal language present. The tone effectively conveys respect and seriousness, significantly contributing to the summary's effectiveness and the reader's engagement.

<Understanding>
DESCRIPTION: The summary of care is written in a way that demonstrates understanding of the source material and how the care provided addressed the patient's presentation.

GRADES:
1 = The summary does not demonstrate any understanding of the patient's condition or care. A clinician reviewing this would never believe that a skilled medical professional wrote this.
2 = The summary demonstrates a very limited understanding of the patient's condition or care. A clinician reviewing this would have trouble believing that a skilled medical professional wrote this.
